I’m **Christopher Torres-Lugo**, Co-Founder & CTO at **Coalesce Finance**, building **CoalesceFi** (coalesce.finance) — a Solana-based onchain credit platform (based on Solend) accelerated by Alliance.xyz.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at **TRM Labs**, where I owned heuristics and models for account-based blockchains across transaction monitoring and wallet screening, expanded labeled address coverage across dozens of blockchains, and led cross-team attribution projects (including Garantex and Nobitex).

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington, where I worked with Dr. Filippo Menczer at the Observatory on Social Media. Before that, I earned an M.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez, an M.P.A. in Program Administration from the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, and a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Puerto Rico at Bayamón.
